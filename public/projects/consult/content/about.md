      <p>At Consult, we strive for excellence in all that we do, and that includes the design and appearance of our website. We want our website to exude professionalism and sophistication, and convey to our clients that we are a high-quality consulting firm.</p>
      <p>To achieve this, we envision a sleek and modern website design with a clean and minimalistic layout. We want to use a color palette that is understated yet luxurious, with accents of gold or silver to add a touch of opulence. The typography should be clear and elegant, with plenty of white space to give the website a spacious and uncluttered feel.</p>
      <p>Overall, we want our website to be a reflection of our brand and our values, and to demonstrate to our clients that we are a trusted and reliable partner for their consulting needs.</p>
